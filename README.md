# AMBER-alert
A group project for **CS4379V: Introduction to Machine Learning**.

This project was divided into three parts:
- Object Identification by Jacob Hope
- Model Identification by Lucas Anseti
- **Color Identification** by Serena Gutierrez

At this current point in time, object & model identification are incomplete.

However, I hope to have a completed repository in the coming months.
