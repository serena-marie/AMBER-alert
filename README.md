# AMBER-alert
A group project for **CS4347: Introduction to Machine Learning**.

This project was divided into three parts:
- Object Identification by Jacob Hope
- Model Identification by Lucas Anseti
- **Color Identification** by Serena Gutierrez

At this current point in time, object & model identification are incomplete.  Color Identification only identifies colors that are dominate as red, blue, or green. Currently working on getting color_detect.py to identfy colors via web colors. I hope to have a completed repository in the coming months.

Update 01-29-17: If Jacob doesn't want to publish his code for O.I., I may code my own version using techniques from a Computer Vision course I'm currently enrolled in. 

## Still to complete
- [ ] Identify all colors
- [ ] Object Identification
- [ ] Model Identification
